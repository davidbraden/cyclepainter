Build instructions
------------------

Building should be fairly simple on Linux provided you have Java and
ant, and Maple is in /usr/local. "ant package" should do everything
needed. If it can't find maple then modifying build.xml may be
needed. The result is a .jar file in "dist"

Execution instructions
----------------------

run.sh attempts to execute CyclePainter. This step is even more
finicky about paths, so may need changing for anything unexpected.


Use
---

The program starts up with a basic elliptic curve being studied. You
can see the branch points plotted, together with cuts going from the
origin (referred to as "base point") to each. An arbitrary choice of
sheets is made at "sheets base" and everything calculated relative to
that.

Two (empty) paths are also created. To use them: 
  + drag the label (e.g. "a[1]") onto the buttons below
    "Active/visible paths".
  + Make sure that button is selected.
  + Left click to add points in the canvas widget. Points lock to
    nearby ones and will continue until the right button is pressed.

Notice that colour changes whenever a cut is crossed to indicate which
sheet the path is on. The "Sheet" combobox selects which sheet the
very first point is on.

Two paths can be displayed at once (the two buttons below
"Active/Visible paths"). The active path is drawn solid, the other
path is drawn dashed.
